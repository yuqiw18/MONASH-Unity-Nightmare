# MONASH-Unity-Nightmare
## Monash University Game Engine Programming Project

Nightmare is the first individual project I have ever done using Unity. It is a wave-based survival first-person shooting game that gives players limited resources to sustain themselves or protect certain objects using different strategies.

This project was originally completed in **2015** and later uploaded to Github in **2018**. The project had been left untouched for a long time as it was not able to compile due to the outdated Unity **4.3** and related packages.

This project now has been updated to Unity **2018 (LTS)**. Compilation errors have been resolved and unspported assets have been replaced. No new content added and it remains identical to the old version created **5** years ago.
